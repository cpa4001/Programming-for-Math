# Programming for Math
**Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)**  

 - To get an introduction into computational mathematics   
 - To develop a use of python outside general programming.
   
 -  To get a higher understanding of higher level mathematics   
   - Complete the four sections of the sage tutorial and its exercises.

**Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)**  
- Read through SDSU sage tutorial  
- Download a copy of Sage  
- Read through other Sage documentation  

**Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)**  
- My own application that will successfully complete mathematical operations.  
- Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.  

**Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process** used to develop or modify a system)  
- I am only a precalculus student; therefore, my mathematical knowledge does not extend that much past Calculus.

**Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)**  
- The tutorial will be available for the duration of the semester.  
- I have all required software.  
- I have access to the internet throughout the semester.  


**Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)**  
- Myself - for my own understanding and growth  
- Professor- for grade  
- Graduate Schools - Project will be added to portfolio and could help in getting into Graduate school or Research.  
- Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job.  

**Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)** </br>

**Week 1: About This Tutorial (Less than 1 Hour)** </br>
I downloaded the open-source sage software on to my computer, and saw the three methods to use sage: a command line, a shell that call on scripts, and an online notebook. I learned about tab completion which is a feature of sage that allows one to enter the first couple letters of a function and [TAB], which returns all functions that are similar to that function. Sage also has a feature to use x.[TAB], where x can be an integer and sage returns all functions that can work with x.

**Week 2:  Sage as a Calculator - Arithmetic and Functions & Solving Equations and Inequalities (3-4 hours)** </br>
Arithmetic and Functions introduces the basic aritmetic operators, and how sage processes commands through order of operations (PEMDAS). In Basic Aritmeric, I saw basic functions in algebra and trigonometry including sin(x), cos(x), abs(x) (absolute value), log(x)/ ln(x), exp(x) (which takes e to any power), and the major constants of pi and e. I also learned of some of the errors that can occur with sage; for example, when dealing with irrational numbers or an infinite amount of digits, computers can round off and perform inaccurate calculations. Additionally, computers process information in binary where humans have the decimal system and this can create a discrepancy in mathematics.

**Week 3: Sage as a Calculator - Calculus (2 hours)** </br>
This module covered the three basic problems in Integral and Differeintal Calculus, allowing me to learn limits, derivatives, integrals. When using sage for Calculus, it is important to define functions and then perform calculations. Starting with Limits, we are trying to find the function value at a certain x-value and sage can help us compute this; however, sage has a small problem when finding limits at discontinuities and this forces the user to use directional limits. We can also solve derivatives and derivatives at certain points with sage which can also bring us to finding the tangent line to a function curve at a certain point.
