# Programming for Math
**Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)**  

 - To get an introduction into computational mathematics   
 - To develop a use of python outside general programming.
   
 -  To get a higher understanding of higher level mathematics   
   - Complete the four sections of the sage tutorial.

**Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)**  
- Read through SDSU sage tutorial  
- Download a copy of Sage  
- Read through other Sage documentation  

**Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)**  
- My own application that will successfully complete mathematical operations.  
- Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.  

**Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process** used to develop or modify a system)  
- I am only a precalculus student; therefore, my mathematical knowledge does not extend that much past Calculus.

**Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)**  
- The tutorial will be available for the duration of the semester.  
- I have all required software.  
- I have access to the internet throughout the semester.  


**Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)**  
- Myself - for my own understanding and growth  
- Professor- for grade  
- Graduate Schools - Project will be added to portfolio and could help in getting into Graduate school or Research.  
- Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job.  

**Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)**
