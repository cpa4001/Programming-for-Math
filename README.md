# Programming-for-Math
Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog) </br>
To get an introduction into computational mathematics </br>
To develop a use of python outside general progamming </br>
To get a higher understanding of higher level mathematics </br>
Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do) </br>
Read through SDSU sage tutorial

Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test) </br>
My own application that will succesfuly complete mathematical operations. </br>
Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system) </br>

Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof) </br>
The courses will be available for the duration of the semester. </br>
I have all required software. </br>

Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations) </br>
Myself - for my own understanding and growth </br>
Professor- for grade </br>

Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs) </br>
